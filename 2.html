  <p>You got the invitation
  You got the right address
  You need some medication?
  The answer's always yes
  A little chance encounter
  Could be the one you've waited for
  Just squeeze a bit more
  Tonight we're on a mission
  Tonight's the casting call
  If this is the real audition
  Oh, God, help us all
  You make the right impression
  Then ev'rybody knows your name
  We're in the fast lane
  Someone in the crowd could be the one you need to know
  The one to finally lift you off the ground
  Someone in the crowd could take you where you wanna go
  If you're the someone ready to be found
  you're the someone ready to be found
  Do what you need to do
  'Til they discover you
  And make you more than who
  You're seeing now
  So with the stars aligned
  I think I'll stay behind
  You've got to go and find
  That someone in the crowd
  That someone in the crowd
  Is someone in the crowd the only thing you really see?
  Watching while the world keeps spinning 'round?
  Somewhere there's a place where I find who I'm gonna be
  A somewhere that's just waiting to be found
  Someone in the crowd could be the one you need to know
  The someone who could lift you off the ground
  Someone in the crowd could take you where you wanna go
  Someone in the crowd could make you
  Someone in the crowd could take you
  Flying off the ground
  If you're the someone ready to be found</p>
