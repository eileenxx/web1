  <p> My aunt used to live in Paris.
  I remember, she used to come home and she would tell us these stories about being abroad.
  And I remember, she told us that she jumped into the river once. Barefoot.

  She smiled...

  Leapt without looking
  And tumbled into the Seine
  The water was freezing
  She spent a month sneezing
  But said she would do it again

  Here's to the ones who dream
  Foolish as they may seem
  Here's to the hearts that ache
  Here's to the mess we make

  She captured a feeling
  Sky with no ceiling
  The sunset inside a frame

  She lived in her liquor
  And died with a flicker
  I'll always remember the flame

  Here's to the ones who dream
  Foolish as they may seem
  Here's to the hearts that ache
  Here's to the mess we make
  </p><p>
  She told me:
  "A bit of madness is key
  To give us new colors to see
  Who knows where it will lead us?
  And that's why they need us"

  So bring on the rebels
  The ripples from pebbles
  The painters, and poets, and plays

  And here's to the fools who dream
  Crazy as they may seem
  Here's to the hearts that break
  Here's to the mess we make

  I trace it all back to then
  Her, and the snow, and the Seine
  Smiling through it
  She said she'd do it again</p>
