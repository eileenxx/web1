  <p> City of stars
  Are you shining just for me?<br>
  City of stars<br>
  There's so much that I can't see<br>
  Who knows?<br>
  I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you<br>
  That now our dreams<br>
  They've finally come true<br>
  City of stars<br>
  Just one thing everybody wants<br>
  There in the bars<br>
  And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants<br>
  It's love<br>
  Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else<br>
  A rush
  A glance
  A touch
  A dance
  A look in somebody's eyes
  To light up the skies
  To open the world and send it reeling
  A voice that says, "I'll be here"
  And "you'll be alright"
  I don't care if I know
  Just where I will go
  'Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling
  A rat-tat-tat on my heart
  Think I want it to stay</p><p>
  City of stars
  Are you shining just for me?
  City of stars
  You never shined so brightly</p>
